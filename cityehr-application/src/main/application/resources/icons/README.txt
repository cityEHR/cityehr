To create a new icon:

1. Copy button template.png to the new file, named after the icon type (e.g new.png for the 'new' button)

2. Using Inkscape (open source image editor - can use any other package with similar functionality to achieve equivalent to the following instructions)

3. Open new.png in Inkscape

4. Make sure the image is the correct size (Inkscape works on DPI which will most likely change the button size when its opened) 
Select the image, press Object | Transform and select the Scale tab. 
Click the button to scale proportionally, select px (default is %) and then adjust the width to 30px, which should make the height 24px. 
Press Apply to see the change in the editor.

For image:

5. Select File | Import and select an image from the glypicons_free png directory.

6. Resize the imported glyphicon (same method as above) to be 14px height and position in the centre of the button image

7. For black glyphicon, reduce opacity to 60% by selecting the glyphicon image, then Object | Stroke and Fill and adjust the Opacity setting

Or for text:

7. Select the text tool (A icon)

8. Choose san-serif, 10pt bold and enter text

9. Then select the Selection tool (pointer icon) and position the text in the moddle of the button

Then to finish

10. Select all (Edit | Select all) and then File | Document Properties then select Resize page to contents or selection

11. Save the file and your icon is done.
