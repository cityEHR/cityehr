        getLatestEntryXQuery.xml
        
        XQuery to return all recorded instances of an entry.
        Applies conditions on the ClinicaDocument in which the entries are found
        
        This is returning all observations for a single (simple) entry.
        Note that the observations may be found in a multiple entry or in more than one entry in a document
        This is because the search is made using the @extension and there may be several entries aliased to that extension.
        
        Similar to getLatestEntrySetXQuery.xml and could be refactored.
