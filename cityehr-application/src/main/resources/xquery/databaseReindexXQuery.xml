        databaseReindexXQuery.xml
        
        Reindex the database at the current context.
        Note - this can take a long time to complete on larger databases, so need to be subject to user confirmation
        
        Time to reindex depends on the cacheSize set in <db-connection> element of eXist main conf.xml file
        cacheSize should be set to 1/3 of the total memory allocated to eXist
        
        0.5Gb database - 19 minutes to reindex with cacheSize=128M
                       - 14 minutes to reindex with cacheSize=512M (25% reduction)
                       
        <path/> gets replaced with the database location to index, starting with /db
