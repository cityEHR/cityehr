        getAllEntryObservationsXQuery.xml
        
        XQuery to return set of all observations for an entry
        Inserts the effectiveTime attribute into each observation
        
        This is an XML document which is read by the cityEHR 
        Any XML elements (i.e. <queryParameters>) are replaced before the query is submitted
        
        This is returning all observations for a single (simple) entry.
        Note that the observations may be found in a multiple entry or in more than one entry in a document
        This is because the search is made using the @extension and there may be several entries aliased to that extension.
